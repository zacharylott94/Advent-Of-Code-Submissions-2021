This repo is for containing and working on my submissions to the ***2021 Advent of Code***. The current plan for these submissions is to write them in **F#** to better my understanding of the langauge. 

Some other languages you *may* see in this repo will include **javascript**, **lua**, and the **bash** scripting language simply because these languages either interest me or I also want to strengthen my knowledge of those as well. 

If I complete solutions in multiple langauges, each language will be in its own folder.
